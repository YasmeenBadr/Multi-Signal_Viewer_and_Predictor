## EEG Signal Viewer & Disease Predictor

### Overview
The **EEG Viewer** is a professional real-time visualization tool that supports multiple analysis modes for EEG data.  
It enables users to upload EEG recordings, visualize them in different modes, and automatically predict the neurological condition using a pretrained **EEGPT-based AI model**.
It classifies it into one of four neurological conditions:
  - **Alzheimer**
  - **Epilepsy**
  - **Parkinson**
  - **Sleep Disorder**

### Viewer Modes

| Mode | Description | Key Features |
|------|--------------|---------------|
| **Time Domain (Default)** | Standard continuous-time plot with fixed viewport. | Play, pause, zoom, pan, speed control. |
| **Polar Mode** | Plots signal magnitude (r) against time (Î¸). | Can run as **fixed time window** or **cumulative** view. |
| **XOR Mode** | Divides signal into time chunks and overlays them using XOR logic. | Highlights differences between repeated patterns. |
| **Recurrence Plot** | Plots two channels (chX, chY) as a cumulative heat map. | Useful for visualizing synchrony and correlation. |

Additional controls:
- Select one or more channels for display.
- For better visualization, hence the EEG signals of different channels look so different we decided to plot them seperately each one in its own graph.
- Band Power graph to illustrate the power of each frequency range (alpha/beta/delta/theta/gamma).
- Adjust time chunk width.
- Choose custom color maps for 2D representations.
- Polar graph can be cumulative plot to retain full history.
- Control speed as preferable.
- Zooming in and out for clearer visualization of signal details.

### EEGPT Model Integration

**Deep Learning Model: Custom EEGPT Fine-Tuning Implementation**

We developed and implemented a comprehensive **PyTorch Lightning** setup to fine-tune the powerful **EEGPT** (Electroencephalography Generative Pre-trained Transformer) for downstream neurological disease classification. This custom, production-ready implementation features:

* **Targeted Classification:** Successfully fine-tuned the model for four distinct diseases: **Alzheimer's**, **Epilepsy**,**Parkinson** and **Sleep Disorder**.
* **Custom PyTorch Data Pipeline:** Engineered a dedicated `DiseaseClassificationDataset` with automatic stratified data splitting (Train/Val/Test), mean centering, and normalization to ensure robust and reproducible training.
* **Model Adaptation:** Implemented a new **Classification Head** and a **Channel Adaptation Layer** to seamlessly connect the pretrained EEGPT encoder to our disease-specific tasks, supporting various channel configurations.
* **Optimized Training:** Leveraged **PyTorch Lightning** for advanced features, including **AdamW** optimization with **Cosine Annealing** scheduling, **Mixed Precision (16-bit)** for efficiency, and comprehensive logging (TensorBoard and CSV).
* **Robust Evaluation:** The system generates detailed evaluation metrics, including **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-scores**, and **Confusion Matrices**, monitored in real-time.

**Supported Diseases (Fine-Tuned):**
* Alzheimer
* Epilepsy
* Sleep Disorder
* Parkinson

## ECG Real-Time Viewer

This repository contains a Flask-based ECG real-time viewer and lightweight model prototypes for detecting abnormalities using both 1D time-domain signals and 2D recurrence-image representations.

## **Highlights**

### Real-Time ECG Visualization
- Live streaming of ECG signals in **multiple representations**:
  - **Time Domain:** raw ECG waveform for each selected channel.
  - **XOR Difference:** visualizes beat-to-beat differences to highlight rhythm changes.
  - **Polar Plot:** maps ECG amplitude and phase relationships between channels.
  - **Recurrence Colormap:** displays nonlinear recurrence patterns and periodicities.
- Built using **Plotly.js** for dynamic, high-performance visual updates.
- Adjustable parameters for **speed**, **window width**, **channel selection**, and **colormap type**.

---

### Smart Data Handling
- Supports drag-and-drop upload of **WFDB records** (`.hea`, `.dat`, `.xyz`).
- Automatically extracts **sampling frequency**, **channel names**, and **diagnostic metadata**.
- Uploaded signals are processed and stored for:
  - Real-time display.
  - Background model training.
  - Recurrence map generation.

---

### Deep Learning Integration

#### **SimpleECG â€“ 1D Convolutional Neural Network**
- **Purpose:** Detects abnormalities directly from the **raw ECG waveform** stream.
- **Input:** 1D signal segments per channel.
- **Architecture Highlights:**
  - Multiple **Conv1D + ReLU** layers to extract temporal heartbeat patterns.
  - **BatchNorm** and **Dropout** layers for generalization and stability.
  - Fully connected layers for classification output.
- **Output:** Predicts whether the current ECG is **Normal**, **Abnormal**, or indicates a specific **Disease**.
- **Optimized for:**  
  Real-time streaming inference â€” updates predictions as new data arrives.

---

#### **Simple2DCNN â€“ Recurrence-Based 2D CNN**
- **Purpose:** Learns **nonlinear temporal structures** and **pattern recurrence** between ECG channels.
- **Input:** 2D **recurrence histograms** or **recurrence plots** generated from channel pairs.
- **Architecture Highlights:**
  - **Conv2D + Pooling layers** to capture spatial texture patterns in recurrence maps.
  - Dense layers classify global recurrence behaviors linked to specific cardiac conditions.
- **Automatic Training:**
  - When a `.hea` record includes diagnosis labels, the backend saves the computed recurrence data into:
    ```
    results/recurrence_data/
    ```
  - A background thread **continuously trains or fine-tunes** the 2D model.
- **Output:** Detects higher-order rhythm irregularities and supports the main prediction model.

---

### Model Fusion & Decision Logic
- Combines predictions from both models:
  - `SimpleECG` â†’ fast temporal prediction.
  - `Simple2DCNN` â†’ deep recurrence-based refinement.
- Uses **weighted confidence fusion** for stable and accurate output.
- Final prediction includes:
  - **Condition label** (Normal / Abnormal / Disease).
  - **Disease name** (if detected).
  - **Model confidence score** displayed on the interface.

---

### System Highlights
- Full **Flask + Torch** backend for computation and inference.
- **Asynchronous streaming** for smooth frontend updates.
- **Bootstrap 5 UI** with dark mode styling and responsive layout.
- Automatic saving of recurrence data for offline training and analysis.
- Modular structure: easy to extend with new models or signal transformations.

## **Setup and Installation**


1. Clone the Repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YasmeenBadr/Task_1_DSP.git


2. Navigate to the Project Directory:

   ```bash
   cd Task_1_DSP


3. Install Required Dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt


4. Run the Application:

   ```bash
   python app.py


After running, open your browser and go to:
ðŸ‘‰ http://127.0.0.1:5000/ecg

---

## **Files of interest**

- `app.py` â€” Flask app bootstrap (registers the `ecg` blueprint).
- `signals/ecg.py` â€” Core streaming logic, prediction wrappers, recurrence image builder, and 2D training hooks.
- `templates/ecg.html` â€” Frontend UI, Plotly plots, controls (channel selection, XOR threshold, polar mode), drag & drop upload.
- `results/recurrence_data/` â€” CSV exports of the two-channel recurrence data saved prior to 2D training.

---

## **How it works**

- The browser polls `/ecg/update` with selected channels and visualization options. The server returns downsampled time series, XOR diffs (for single-channel), polar data, recurrence colormap data (for 2 channels), and predictions.
- 1D predictions: a rolling per-channel buffer is accumulated and passed to a small 1D CNN to predict Normal/Abnormal. Predictions are smoothed over a short window.
- 2D predictions: recurrence images are generated from two-channel pairs and used for a separate 2D CNN. Training runs in a background thread when a WFDB record with labels is loaded.

---

## **Developer notes & tuning**

- Smoothing window: `SMOOTH_WINDOW` in `signals/ecg.py` controls temporal averaging of probabilities.
- Minimum samples: `MIN_PRED_LEN` controls when the 1D model will run (helps avoid padding bias).
- Recurrence CSVs are written to `results/recurrence_data/` before training; useful for reproducibility.
