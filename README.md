## Introduction

The **Signal Viewer Project** is designed to visualize, analyze, and classify multiple signal types across biomedical and physical domains.  
It provides **multi-channel interactive visualization tools** combined with **AI-driven classification** that detects abnormalities in real-time.

Each module (EEG, ECG, Radar, Doppler) includes:
- A **real-time multi-signal viewer** with multiple visualization modes.
- A **deep-learning model** trained on domain-specific data for abnormality detection.
- A **modular design** allowing users to plug in new models or visual modes.

## EEG Signal Viewer & Disease Predictor

### Overview
The **EEG Viewer** is a professional real-time visualization tool that supports multiple analysis modes for EEG data.  
It enables users to upload EEG recordings, visualize them in different modes, and automatically predict the neurological condition using a pretrained **EEGPT-based AI model**.

Upon uploading an EEG file:
- The system can detect **whether the signal is normal or abnormal**.
- If abnormal, it classifies it into one of four neurological conditions:
  - **Alzheimer**
  - **Epilepsy**
  - **Parkinson**
  - **Sleep Disorder**

### Viewer Modes

| Mode | Description | Key Features |
|------|--------------|---------------|
| **Time Domain (Default)** | Standard continuous-time plot with fixed viewport. | Play, pause, zoom, pan, speed control. |
| **Polar Mode** | Plots signal magnitude (r) against time (Œ∏). | Can run as **fixed time window** or **cumulative** view. |
| **XOR Mode** | Divides signal into time chunks and overlays them using XOR logic. | Highlights differences between repeated patterns. |
| **Recurrence Plot** | Plots two channels (chX, chY) as a cumulative heat map. | Useful for visualizing synchrony and correlation. |

Additional controls:
- Select one or more channels for display.
- For better visualization, hence the EEG signals of different channels look so different we decided to plot them seperately each one in its own graph.
- Band Power graph to illustrate the power of each frequency range (alpha/beta/delta/theta/gamma).
- Adjust time chunk width.
- Choose custom color maps for 2D representations.
- Polar graph can be cumulative plot to retain full history.
- Control speed as preferable.
- Zooming in and out for clearer visualization of signal details.

### EEGPT Model Integration

**Deep Learning Model: Custom EEGPT Fine-Tuning Implementation**

We developed and implemented a comprehensive **PyTorch Lightning** setup to fine-tune the powerful **EEGPT** (Electroencephalography Generative Pre-trained Transformer) for downstream neurological disease classification. This custom, production-ready implementation features:

* **Targeted Classification:** Successfully fine-tuned the model for four distinct diseases: **Alzheimer's**, **Epilepsy**,**Parkinson** and **Sleep Disorder**.
* **Custom PyTorch Data Pipeline:** Engineered a dedicated `DiseaseClassificationDataset` with automatic stratified data splitting (Train/Val/Test), mean centering, and normalization to ensure robust and reproducible training.
* **Model Adaptation:** Implemented a new **Classification Head** and a **Channel Adaptation Layer** to seamlessly connect the pretrained EEGPT encoder to our disease-specific tasks, supporting various channel configurations.
* **Optimized Training:** Leveraged **PyTorch Lightning** for advanced features, including **AdamW** optimization with **Cosine Annealing** scheduling, **Mixed Precision (16-bit)** for efficiency, and comprehensive logging (TensorBoard and CSV).
* **Robust Evaluation:** The system generates detailed evaluation metrics, including **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-scores**, and **Confusion Matrices**, monitored in real-time.

**Supported Diseases (Fine-Tuned):**
* Alzheimer
* Epilepsy
* Sleep Disorder
* Parkinson

## ‚ù§Ô∏è ECG Real-Time Viewer

Highlights

- Live streaming ECG visualization (time domain, XOR diff, polar, recurrence colormap) using Plotly.

- Drag & drop upload of WFDB records (.hea, .dat, .xyz) to visualize and evaluate signals.

- Lightweight 1D CNN classifier (SimpleECG) for time-domain prediction.

- Lightweight 2D CNN classifier (Simple2DCNN) trained on recurrence-style 2D histograms from two-channel pairs.

- Background training of the 2D model when labeled data is uploaded; recurrence data saved in results/recurrence_data/.

Setup and Installation

Clone the Repository

Bash

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YasmeenBadr/Task_1_DSP.git
```

Navigate to the Project Directory

Bash

```bash
cd Task_1_DSP
```

Install Required Dependencies

Bash

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the Application

Bash

```bash
python app.py
```

After running, open your browser and go to:

üëâ http://127.0.0.1:5000/ecg

How It Works

The browser polls /ecg/update with selected channels and visualization options.

The server returns:

Downsampled time series

XOR diffs (for single-channel)

Polar data

Recurrence colormap data (for two channels)

Predictions from 1D and 2D models

Prediction Flow:

1D Predictions:
A rolling per-channel buffer is passed to a small 1D CNN to predict Normal/Abnormal. Predictions are smoothed over a short window.

2D Predictions:
Recurrence images are generated from two-channel pairs and used for a separate 2D CNN.

Training runs in a background thread when labeled WFDB records are loaded.

Developer Notes & Tuning

Parameter	Description
SMOOTH_WINDOW	Controls temporal averaging of probabilities.
MIN_PRED_LEN	Minimum samples before 1D model runs (prevents padding bias).
results/recurrence_data/	Stores CSV recurrence data for reproducibility.
